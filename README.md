# Color-palette

Program imitating a colour palette. The idea came from the fact that colours in computers are mixtures of red, green and blue. Initially it was meant to be for the colour to change approprietly to the mouse position on the screen, but unfortunately having only two dimension, there is a rectangle that substitute that third variable.

Cursor's 'x' value in the smaller rectangle indicates percentage of colour red, 'y' - green, value of 'x' of the smaller rectangle in the window - blue. (percentage of coordinates in terms of the sides of the smaller rectangle resemble the percentages of hues)
